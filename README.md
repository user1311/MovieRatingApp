Please before run, change connection strings in API project to match your local machine (appsettings.json), since my MSSQLServer is using my pc name.

On first run please wait for db seed, API will open swagger, until swagger UI is loaded completely, it means that seeder is working.

DB seeder will seed Movies and Shows from external API, also it will add test user and test role, takes minute or two, so have patience.

Test user :
  Username : testTest1@test.com
  Password : testTest_1234
